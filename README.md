## Description

Holidaze, a new accommodation booking site, tasked us with building a cutting-edge frontend for their application. 
This was the entry point to our final exam at Noroff School of technology and digital media. With a focus on user experience, we needed to develop a modern booking system using the official API documentation. Our project dealt with two aspects. The customer-facing website for holiday bookings and the admin portal for venue and booking management. For customers, the goal was to create a visually appealing interface for easy booking. The admin portal was to offer venue owners hassle-free registration and management options. This project is aimed to show our skills in real-world web development providing the HolidazeApp with a functional and visually appealing frontend. As a user you can sign in, login, search, book venues and change your avatar. If you have registered as a venue manager upon signup, you can list your own homes for rent, edit/update them, delete them and check for bookings under your homes. The user profile was devided into tabs for the user to get a full overview on one page and full control over profile, bookings, added venues and bookings made on them.
